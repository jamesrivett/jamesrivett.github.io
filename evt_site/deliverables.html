      <h2>ROS2/VNC Workspace Container</h2>
      <p>
        When solving problems with robotics, developers (ourselves included) often utilize a wide variety of
        technologies on every level of the stack.
        The Robot Operating System (ROS2) framework aims to consolidate the use of these components. The
        term ‘Operating System’ in ROS2 is a misnomer in this case because it does not run on the bare metal of
        the robot’s computer as one might expect. Instead, it runs as a regular process on an x86 machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it uses many low-level libraries to seamlessly communicate with various
        hardware and software, ROS2 always needs to have access to the EXACT same set of libraries and
        dependencies wherever it is run. Because of this, ROS2 only runs on a specific LTS release of Ubuntu;
        one that is guaranteed to have all of these necessary libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue is this: not everyone on EVT has the excess hardware, Linux experience, or even time to install
        the specific version of Ubuntu needed to run and develop for ROS2. To remedy this, I've developed
        a docker-based workspace that was intended to allow users of any OS to develop for Voltron’s ROS2 stack.
        Within a few months, the workspace container was working perfectly when run on a Linux-baseed host OS.
        When the time came to test the improved workpsace container on other operating systems, I encountered
        many different issues ranging from permissions to networking. After myself and other members of the team
        remediated as many of those issues as we could find, we still only got a black screen when starting the 
        workspace under WSL or MacOS.
