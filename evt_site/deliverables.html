      <h2>ROS2/VNC Workspace Container</h2>
      <p>
        When solving problems with robotics, developers (ourselves included) often utilize a wide variety of
        technologies on every level of the stack.
        The Robot Operating System (ROS2) framework aims to consolidate the use of these components. The
        term ‘Operating System’ in ROS2 is a misnomer in this case because it does not run on the bare metal of
        the robot’s computer as one might expect. Instead, it runs as a regular process on an x86 machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it uses many low-level libraries to seamlessly communicate with various
        hardware and software, ROS2 always needs to have access to the EXACT same set of libraries and
        dependencies wherever it is run. Because of this, ROS2 only runs on a specific LTS release of Ubuntu;
        one that is guaranteed to have all of these necessary libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue is this: not everyone on EVT has the excess hardware, Linux experience, or even time to install
        the specific version of Ubuntu needed to run and develop for ROS2. To remedy this, I've developed
        a docker-based workspace that was intended to allow users of any OS to develop for Voltron’s ROS2 stack.
        Within a few months, the workspace container was working perfectly when run on a Linux-baseed host OS.
        When the time came to test the improved workpsace container on other operating systems, I encountered
        many different issues ranging from permissions to networking. After myself and other members of the team
        remediated as many of those issues as we could find, we still only got a black screen when starting the 
        workspace under WSL or MacOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since many of the Windows users on the team were already working on projects that didn’t
        explicitly require the ROS2 workspace, we decided to abandon efforts on the VNC/ROS2 workspace and
        move on to the steering study. While we didn’t achieve the main goal of platform-agnosticism, I learned
        a lot about Docker during the process and we can still run the VNC server container on the EVT server 
        for people to connect to remotely. It’s not running on their machine, but Windows and Mac users do
        have a workspace to use if they need it.

      <h2>Steering Angle Motion Caputre Study</h2>
      <p>
        Our current autonomous system is chiefly controlled using Model Predictive Control (MPC). This model
        considers multiple observed state variables in addition to the current input state to forecast
        which control commands would bring the kart closest to the line it is trying to follow. The inherent issue
        here is that our steering system is controlled by a commanded number of motor rotations, but our MPC
        outputs a steering angle.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is currently, that control unit is what handles the translation from steering angle
        to motor position. Currently, this translation function is currently just an estimate; there was no
        empirical data that motivated it and is therefore not as accurate as it could be. To remedy this, we studied
        effective angle of the steering joint using motion capture technology, fitted a function to that data, then
        used its inverse to get a motor position as the output when a requested angle is given as an input. This
        means the resulting steering angle from the control unit should be much closer to what MPC deemed
        optimal.
      </p>

        Here are some videos from that testing with the motion capture technology:
